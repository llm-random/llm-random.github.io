    "text": "Sparse neural networks have garnered attention due to their theoretical promise of lowered computational demands and memory savings. However, to this date, the theoretical gains have largely failed to materialize due to the lack of hardware support for this kind of models. In this work, we explore the idea of neuron recycling which is inspired by pruning - a method often employed to induce sparsity in neural networks. We also present lessons we have learned along the way."

    "text": "Magnitudes in openly available pretrained models\n\nSo far, we have performed a series of experiments on relatively small architectures. We were curious to see how our observations would translate to well-established, large-scale foundation models like BERT Large or T5.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n\n\nThere is a clear difference between the plots above. Magnitudes in T5 seem similar to those in our smaller models, while BERT presents a more balanced distribution. What could account for these variations? We discovered that the use of weight decay in BERT Large plays a significant role. This simple but widely used technique has an important impact on the distribution. \nThese findings support the idea of exploring neuron recycling and offer a good foundation for further experiments. In the next sections, we will present results on this topic and share our insights."
